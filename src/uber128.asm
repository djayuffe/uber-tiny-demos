; UBER128 - a 128-byte-class DOS demo, in 79 bytes: rainbow rings, endlessly flowing out
; of the screen centre.
; NASM: nasm -f bin src/uber128.asm -o UBER128.COM      Target: DOS/DOSBox, VGA, 386+
;
; Size hacks:
;  * DOS enters a .COM with BX = 0, so BL is the palette index and then the frame counter
;    with no setup, and AX = 0 so `mov al,13h` is enough for the mode set.
;  * The VGA BIOS leaves the DAC write index at 0 after a mode set, so the palette is
;    simply streamed to port 3C9h: three OUTs per entry from one running value:
;    R = i, G = 2i, B = 4i (the DAC keeps 6 bits). Nothing but doubling, yet it gives a
;    dense, saturated, seamless-looking rainbow.
;  * There is no pixel loop nest. DI runs over the whole 64 KB segment and wraps to 0 by
;    itself, which ends the frame; x and y come from one DIV by 320 (AX = y, DX = x).
;  * r^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 instead of a square root; the colour is r^2/64 + frame counter.
;  * One short wait for retrace (70 fps); Esc is read straight from port 60h.
